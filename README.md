# WEEKLY-Q-As
Here is the place for:

ðŸš€Questions regarding MATRIX P2P, nodes, the MATRIX network, Consensus algorithms, etc

ðŸš€Progress update on the development of MATRIX, milestones, etc

ðŸš€MATRIX AI development

Questions of the top concerns are mainly collected from MATRIX community members, and our experts will always be there to answer and explain.

Thanks to all our community members and fans who sent us questions regarding our work. We received many questions and selected the most repeated ones.


###  QUESTION RECAP(2018.5.30)

1.Do clusters play a part in consensus or is it just the delegated nodes? do they check that the work of the delegate is correct?(Node related Questions) 

2.Can you commit a date for main net token swap?


3.A detailed explanation of the delegate nodes (supernodes): How MATRIX can be more decentralized than EOS? How to choose delegate nodes and achieve consensus?

4.Weâ€™ve recently discovered the BatchOverflow (link) vulnerability bug on ERC-20 smartcontracts. Let us assume that we found a bug on a MATRIX intelligent smartcontract, would the AI automatically fix and secure ALL the smart contracts on the MATRIX blockchain?

5.Can you anticipated ROI for a Masternode and confirm whether the 10k token threshold is confirmed?


### QUESTIONS RECAP (2018.6.11)

1.Despite the great answers from the team, it seems like each week we are left with new questions. Would you be able to release complete yellow-papers detailing completely the technical design framework for consensus, node election, and smart contracts?

2.What hardware do you think will be required in September and December to run a node capable of 1, 000 tps?

3.How many kinds of masternodes will be there?


### QUESTIONS RECAP (2018.6.21)

1.The recent github upload of the crypto GO implementation tells us the different things which have been done and what it contains, for example:
"Signature_cgo.go and crypto.go under crypto are ethereum's original crypto algorithm interface files for external calling, and based on this, we introduced two more interfaces SignEx and VerifySignatureEx which will be used for signature verification. Ecrecover and EcrecoverEx interfaces supports public key recovery. generateKeyEx is the new interface for publick/private key generation"

But it does not tell us why these new interfaces are included and why they are an improvement to the original Ethereum code. Can you tell us?

2.As you know, the consensus mechanism for a project is the most important part for security. Given that MATRIX is using MCMC as a cryptographic hash, will you ensure it is academically and commercially peer reviewed before it goes live? Sha256 and similar algorithms have gone through rigorous academic review.


3.What are and what is needed to have 1000 TPS, which are required to have a mining MATRIX node?

4.As you know, the consensus mechanism for a project is the most important part for security. Given that MATRIX is using MCMC as a cryptographic hash, will you ensure it is academically and commercially peer reviewed before it goes live? Sha256 and similar algorithms have gone through rigorous academic review.

### QUESTIONS COMING NEXT (2018.6.29)

1.When can we expect the paper with additional details about  MATRIXâ€™s unique algorithm? 

2.Can you share what CPU youâ€™re using in your Dell R730 server? Is it a 1x CPU or 2x? How much RAM are you using? Some basic specifications will make it easier to research servers and gear.
