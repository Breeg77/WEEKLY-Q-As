###  QUESTION RECAP(2018.5.30)

1.Do clusters play a part in consensus or is it just the delegated nodes? do they check that the work of the delegate is correct?(Node related Questions) 

2.Can you commit a date for main net token swap?


3.A detailed explanation of the delegate nodes (supernodes): How MATRIX can be more decentralized than EOS? How to choose delegate nodes and achieve consensus?

4.Weâ€™ve recently discovered the BatchOverflow (link) vulnerability bug on ERC-20 smartcontracts. Let us assume that we found a bug on a MATRIX intelligent smartcontract, would the AI automatically fix and secure ALL the smart contracts on the MATRIX blockchain?

5.Can you anticipated ROI for a Masternode and confirm whether the 10k token threshold is confirmed?
