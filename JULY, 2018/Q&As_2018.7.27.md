### Q1. GitHub update on the PoC, Python Version (last update was 2 months ago), the team puts "Weekly Update" in the folder but seeing no progress.

ANSWER: The Python version of codes updated 2 months ago is a PoC of MATRIXâ€™S election algorithms. And later we switched to GO for the coding (URL: https://github.com/MatrixAINetwork/MatrixAIPOC_GO).

Currently, there are two versions of GO codes updated on github, which involve the following features: 

- support the generation of Computing Power Rental Network
- support the generation of Validator Network as well as the updates of network status
- periodic broadcasts of selected (winning) nodes: selection results will be broadcast to the peer nodes
- Full nodes will insert the node selection information into globallist upon receiving and verifying the selection results
- Periodic refresh of globallist and removal of dropped nodes or nodes facing unsteady network
- introduce a new boot process
- introduce a new static synchronization process
- introduce a new election algorithm
- introduce a new scheduler module as well as network topology generation process
