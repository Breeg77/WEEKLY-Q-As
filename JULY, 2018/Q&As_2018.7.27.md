### Q1. Lets say I own 50000 MAN and my brother owns 50000 MAN，From an economic perspective – would it be more profitable to combine our tokens to run a Verification Masternode and split the profits, or run 2 x 50,000 token Mining Masternodes, separately?

ANSWER: To begin – let’s clarify a few things so we’re all on the same page. As you may know, only a Supernode can act as a miner or validator. Both Miner Supernodes and Validator supernodes will be selected from all eligible masternodes based on a fixed selection cycle and MATRIX’s unique algorithm. No single Masternode can be a Supernode forever.

The rewards for Miners and Validators are not the same.

Rewards for miners work in the following way:

- The available total payout is equal to the total number of tokens x 40% x 25%
- 1/8th of this available payout is equally distributed between the selected Miner Masternodes.
- The remaining 7/8ths are distributed between the selected Miner Supernodes based on a Proof of Work algorithm.
- Miner Masternodes that aren’t selected as Miner Supernodes can still earn rewards by providing computing power to external parties.

Rewards for validator supernodes are a little different:

- As you all know by now, a total of 165 validator masternodes are automatically selected based on total deposits
- The total payout available to validator nodes equals the total number of tokens x 40% x 20%
- 1/8th of the total available payout is distributed to these 165 validator masternodes
- The remaining 7/8ths is distributed equally among the 11 selected Validator Supernodes

So, there isn’t a simple answer to your question. Several factors will determine which option is more profitable at any given moment.


### Q2. What will happen when all MAN tokens are distributed? How will MATRIX continue to reward miners?

ANSWER: When the total rewards for miners are exhausted, transaction fees and commissions paid for computing services will be used as the main rewards for mining.

All masternodes will be eligible to undertake CPU computing tasks or AI computing tasks to receive rewards. These rewards will be assigned through a task distribution network, validation network or external agents.
