#### Q1. Can you explain more about the selection process for masternodes? Does holding more MAN increase the odds of being selected for a masternode? How many masternodes are available and for how long can someone be assigned as masternode?

ANSWER: There are two primary kinds of masternodes in the MATRIX project: Miner masternodes and Validation masternodes.

A miner masternode requires a deposit of 10K MAN and processing power to run 1,000 TPS. 
And a validation masternode requires a deposit of 100K MAN deposit and processing power to run 2,000 TPS.

### Miner node:

The selection occurs once per hour. This design provides a steady and standard time interval for leasing computing power. It also ensures every masternode has an opportunity to become a supernode. Statistically speaking, any given masternode is likely to be selected as SuperNode once every two weeks, even if there are 10,000 masternodes.

### Validator node:

Node selection takes place once per hour. 
32 SuperNodes are selected for mining and validating. 
An additional 11 SuperNodes are responsible for 
supervision and judgement to validating transactions 
over the distributed network. 

This cycle design ensures consistency 
of processing transactions across the entire blockchain. 
Considering potential instabilities that could arise 
during the handover between validators and miners, 
there will be a shift of 16 blocks 
between the selection cycle and validation cycle. 

The maximum number of validator SuperNodes per round is 11. 
Up to three layers of supporting validator nodes are available. 
There are 22 standby validator nodes in layer 1; 
44 for layer 2 and 88 for layer 3. 
There means a total of 165 available validator nodes in total.

#### Q2. Can you explain more about the rewards system in place for validator nodes? So far only the distribution model is known.

ANSWERï¼šValidator nodes: Validators are critical for ensuring the safety and integrity of the blockchain. Specifically, they support the RPS - Remote Procedure Call service.

There are a total of 165 validator nodes. In addition to set rewards for participation.
The validator node will receive 1/8th of the available payout for validation.
The remaining 7/8th of the validator payout will be distributed equally among the 11 delegate validator nodes.
