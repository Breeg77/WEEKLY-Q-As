 ### Q1. Is it true that the random selection algorithm ties a unique ID to your hardware setup for the selection of nodes? If yes, does this mean the odds of being selected for a node increase the more devices you hold MAN on?

ANSWER: The answer is NO. The random selection algorithm will not fix a unique ID to an individual hardware setup. Rather, it is determined by all 165 validator nodes. Each validator node plays only a small role , which precludes any single validator node from cheating.


### Q2. Will miners be able to use multiple separate devices to mine on the same node? The two mining setups shown were each a single device, but it could be more practical for miners to use multiple devices to reach the 1000tps for a MN.

ANSWER: We do support multiple devices mining on a single node. However we should clarify that the computing power (1000 TPS for example) is not the primary criteria for masternode selection. Masternode selection mainly depends on the stakes and network uptime. Only after a node becomes a masternode, is it qualified to be selected for the 21 miner nodes making up the Supernode.
