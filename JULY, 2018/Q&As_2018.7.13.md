 ### Q1. Is it true that the random selection algorithm ties a unique ID to your hardware setup for the selection of nodes? If yes, does this mean the odds of being selected for a node increase the more devices you hold MAN on?

ANSWER: The answer is NO. The random selection algorithm will not fix a unique ID to an individual hardware setup. Rather, it is determined by all 165 validator nodes. Each validator node plays only a small role , which precludes any single validator node from cheating.
