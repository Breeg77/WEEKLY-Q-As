### Q1.  Despite the great answers from the team, it seems like each week we are left with new questions. Would you be able to release complete yellow-papers detailing completely the technical design framework for consensus, node election, and smart contracts?

One challenge, is that the scope of our technology is always evolving with new concerns. 

For example, in order to prevent renting out processing to support a 51% attack, we’ve changed the rules of our verification mechanism, in which case publishing the original documentation would have caused confusion.

Another example is related with the 11 verifier supernodes. Our team ran simulations to evaluate the best method for preventing fraud or an EOS–like vulnerability. As a result the project team identified the Dark Guardian role as an effective deterrent against DDoS attacks. We also introduced an impeachment mechanism for further security.

Or considering our consensus algorithm, we are pursuing a combined CPU-like GPU-like solution, but current encryption algorithms are vulnerable to pooled mining attacks. We are currently collaborating with a famous manufacturer of Bitcoin mining hardware on a custom AI chip. But need to consider the possibility of ASIC processing attacks. So our technology team is currently taking an integral approach to considering related issues. We witnessed a prior example with B**Chain, who was collaborating with this manufacturer, but the technical tean misidentified an ASIC-like algorithm, when it was in fact GPU-like algorithm. As a result investors lost a lot of money.


### Q2. What hardware do you think will be required in September and December to run a node capable of 1000 tps?

We’re currently using DELL R730 as test nodes, which meets the 1,000 TPS requirement. You can achieve substantial TPS gains by clustering.
 
We’re using a VU7P + ZU 21 DR FPGA prototype chip. The ZU 21 DR component is composed of ARM Cortex A53 superscaler processor.

This supports a "two miners and a verifier" mode. And this setup has reached 50K TPS.

### Q3. How many kinds of masternodes will be there?
