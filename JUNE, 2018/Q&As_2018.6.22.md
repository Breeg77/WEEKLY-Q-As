#### Q1. As you know, the consensus mechanism for a project is the most important part for security. Given that MATRIX is using MCMC as a cryptographic hash, will you ensure it is academically and commercially peer reviewed before it goes live? Sha256 and similar algorithms have gone through rigorous academic review.

In order to meet people's expectations on the security of MCMC, MATRIX will certainly carry out academic peer evaluations as well as commercial security reviews before it goes live. But before this is done, we will take a workaround which focuses on the SHA-3 (Secure Hash Algorithm 3). And we will switch to MCMC finally when academica and commercial peer reviews generate a positive result.

Actually, SHA-3 is also vulnerable to attacks to some extent. That's why we have always been researching and testing on MCMC, and seeking for room of upgrade as well.

#####WHY TRADITIONAL SHA-1/2 ARE NOT SECURE

You can refer to the following information to gain an understanding why they are unsecure.

On Feb 23, 2017, Google announced first successful SHA1 collision ([https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html](https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html)).

##### About SHA-2

In January 2011 (with NIST document SP800-131A), SHA-2 became the new recommended hashing standard. SHA-2, is often called the SHA-2 family of hashes, because it contains many different-length hashes, including 224-bit, 256-bit, 384-bit, and 512-bit digests (each discussed and released in related NIST Federal Information Processing Standard documents). You can't determine which SHA-2 bit length someone is using based on the name alone, but the most popular one is 256-bits by a large margin.


##### WHY SHA-3 AS A WORKAROUND

As time goes by, SHA algorithms will become more and more unsecure. The reason why NIST selected SHA-3 born in an open contest as a new standard (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3) is that it was not deriving from SHA family. Instead, SHA-3 has a totally different maths algorithm. NIST published a draft standard and officially named it as SHA-3 on August 5th, 2015. SHA-3 then became the new recommended hashing standard.
