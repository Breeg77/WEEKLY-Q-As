#### Q1. Does the following HW configuration meet the requirements of MAN mining?

You could say this configuration meets entry-level mining requirements, but since it only supports a single quad-core processor, the setup might not be sufficiently optimized to reach the desired TPS. 

In the Miner that MATRIX designed:

- One core is dedicated to network processing 

(Note: 1,000 TPS suggests a respective traffic of over 20Mbp)

- Another core is dedicated to remote procedure calls (RPC)

(This provides a shared web server, managing block data, and proving data to other nodes when requested.) 

- One core is for encryption and decryption, as well as validation 

(current standards supports 3,000 - 7,000 operations per second, but we’re focused on solving peak requirements, not just average one)
 
- Another core will be used to process transactions, (including removing duplicate transactions), 
move memory, as well as handle compression and decompression.

- After all of these processes are covered
the remaining cores will be used for PoW computing. 

We also need to factor in additional processing power for 
computing AI applications as well as providing services to other nodes and external users
This will generate extra rewards.

In terms of mining this would be an entry-level machine.

#### Q2. When can we expect the paper with additional details about  MATRIX’s unique algorithm? 

We’ve already announced the overall mechanism of the MATRIX consensus algorithm. 

It’s based on the random selection of 21 miners and 11 validators. Validator nodes process validation and smart contracts. 

Miners will perform mining. 

There are also randomly concealed “Dark Guardians” 
who monitor for fraud and conspiring among miners or validators.

The final paper detailing our consensus algorithm will be submitted for peer review, and published to https://arxiv.org/ in this September.
