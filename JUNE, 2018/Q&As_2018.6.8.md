 ### Q1. We’ve recently discovered the BatchOverflow (link) vulnerability bug on ERC-20 smartcontracts. Let us assume that we found a bug on a MATRIX intelligent smartcontract, would the AI automatically fix and secure ALL the smart contracts on the MATRIX blockchain?

Let’s start by looking at the framework for our MATRIX SmartContracts.

Here is a more detailed explanation.

1.Our Semantic Engine will use semantic analysis to explore vulnerabilities. We are introducing AI functionality for smart matching, which matches images based on CFG (Control Flow Graph) and DFG (Data Flow Graph).  

2.Our secure smart contracts are implemented through our Smart Contract SDK.   

3.The whole security protocol is guaranteed via formal verification.

4.MATRIX is employing a dual approach to safeguard our smart contracts:

- A PC (Policy Checker) assesses vulnerabilities
- An IE (Inference Engine) and AI-assisted recognition detects vulnerabilities.


### Q2. Can you anticipated ROI for a Masternode and confirm whether the 10k token threshold is confirmed?

ROI in the MATRIX project can be estimated based on the following model:

1.Of the remaining 40% of *1billion tokens:  
 
- 25% will be distributed to miners  
- 20% will be distributed to those who help with verification
- 50% will be distributed to power contributors doing AI computing

The remaining 5% of tokens will be used to reward our MATRIX community and distributed according to community votes. 

This is the distribution ratio proposed by our MATRIX Dev team.
We’re asking for consensus from the whole community to finalize the plan. 

We plan to share a distribution proposal every 6 months,
Then we will introduce a voting mechanism to survey the community. 

If no consensus is reached, we will go back to our initial proposal. 
And, we will switch to another one when possible.

2.Our MATRIX PoW verification is based on the random selection of 21 masternodes. 

Each masternode will be awarded 10%  of the average mining rewards for a specified interval -- provided it is online long enough. 

The remaining 90% will be distributed based on a competition of computing power.  

When a miner is selected as a masternode, it will get a basic reward based on three rankings: 

1)Service time 

2)Deposits

3)and TPS. 

A miner can then compete for the remaining 90% of mining rewards based on computing power.  

The MCMC algorithms used for mining are created by CPU-like/GPU-like algorithm generator. 

3.In order to increase ROI and maximize rewards, 
we recommend people to deploy as much AI and CPU computing power as possible for external service. 

All computing power in the network will be pooled together. 
Any node sharing its computing power to work on an assignment will get a specific amount of reward, according to its share of the total work.

### Q3. Regarding the mining power that will be generated once the mainnet is launched, will the person mining be able to decide where his/her mining power generated will be utilized? For example, If I am mining the MAN coin, I want 50% of the power used by my machine to be used for cancer diagnosis and the remaining 50% to be used for building infrastructure...will this be possible?

We actually provide miners with three choices for how their mining power is utilized: 

They can choose to be either a:

- Validator
- AI and GPU/CPU computing power contributor 
- Miner

Different requirements will apply to each class: 

A validator, is responsible for maintaining the security of the network and avoiding fraudulent behaviors from miners or other validators. 
A minimum deposit of 100,000 MANs is required to become a validator. 
The more, the closer to real-time.

The threshold to become a miner is a deposit of 10,000 MANs and minimum 1,000 TPS 
A miner will have a base reward, in addition to their mining reward. 

The core aim of Matrix is to pool computing power to serve for the whole network. 
This means assigning AI calculations for the participating nodes to complete. 

There may not be a high volume of tasks in the beginning, so we’ve introduced a class of computing tasks that provide a public service. 
These will have no rewards but honor value. 
Once a real task is assigned and completed, the system will automatically assign a considerable number of rewards.

Another option for earning rewards, is for a node to act as a “Dark Guardian.” This involves monitoring whether a verifier or miner is cheating. 

If a bad actor is discovered, it can broadcast across the network, and eliminate the cheater. 
It is then left for others to discuss how to reward this “guardian”. This form of reward is distributed by the foundation and is based on the timestamp.

### What protections and assurances will MATRIX offer Investors and companies planning an ICO on the MATRIX platform? (KYC, Compliance, no delays, fairness for everyone etc.)

MATRIX will conduct contract audits and security verifications. We will also further rely on contributors from our “Dark Guardian“ program to proactively identify vulnerabilities for swift corrective measures. 

### Is the mining equipment exclusively developed by MATRIX, or through a collaboration with AMD and Nvida?

In May we announced the prototype specifications and supporting code for the AI FPGA. The codes for our hardware and AI algorithms are compatible for use with AMD and Nvida GPUs.

### How do you plan to handle varying linguistic interpretations when using artificial intelligence in smart contracts? For example: Borrow $1,000 USD from account 3. How do you clarify the lender and recipient relationship?

In this kind of situation, the system will analyze the most appropriate transactional template to provide. Let’s consider a sentence that has an  ambiguous relationship structure like, “I’m filming Robert behind the camera.” This might could imply I’m filming Robert with the camera, or perhaps I’m filming Robert while he’s using a camera.

We will clarify the relationship by providing structured fields that designate all relevant subjects, objects, the conditions of an action, and remitting/receiving relationship of a transaction. 

The structured template will provide structured guidance for parties to specify unequivocal transaction parameters. 



### What hardware do you think will be required in September and December to run a node capable of 1000 tps?

Testings are currently carried out on DELLR730 where transactions of 1K TPS can be supported. And clusters will be helpful to improve TPS.

In addition, we use FPGA boards with VU7P+ZU21DR and deploy two miner nodes/one verifier node based on ARM A53 of ZU 21 DR. In such case, 50K TPS can be achieved without using encryption and signature.


### It seems like each week we are left with new questions despite the great answers from the team. Is there any reason you cannot release complete yellow-papers detailing completely the technical design framework for consensus, node election, and smart contracts? 

The reason why we haven’t released a final paper is that MATRIXS’ technical specifications are still in persistent evolution. We want to illustrate this from the following examples.

First, in order to avoid 51% attacks via computing power rentals, we have recently modified the rules of verifier nodes. In such case, we eliminate the possible misunderstandings that may be involved in the paper.
 
Another example is related with the 11 verifier committee.  We have been thinking how we can avoid bad behaviors or similar vulnerabilities that EOS faced. After many times of simulations, we decided to introduce a concept of “DARK GUARDIAN”， which can avoid DDos attacks, as well as a mechanism for eliminating cheaters.

And last we want to talk about the consensus algorithm. We have been looking for CPU-like/GPU-like algorithms, but current crypto algorithm is easily subject to computing power rental attacks. Meanwhile, we are cooperating with BITMAIN recently on an AI chip related project, which also put us in the risk of BITMAIN mining and ASIC computing power attacks, so the technical team is figuring out how to address those possible issues. We must draw a lesson from BYTOM, also a co-founded project of BITMAIN. The algorithm actually used is GPU-like, but the team didn’t recognize this and regarded it as ASIC-like, which caused a big loss to the investors
