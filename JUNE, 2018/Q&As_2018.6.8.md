 ### Q1. We’ve recently discovered the BatchOverflow (link) vulnerability bug on ERC-20 smartcontracts. Let us assume that we found a bug on a Matrix intelligent smartcontract, would the AI automatically fix and secure ALL the smart contracts on the Matrix blockchain?

Let’s start by looking at the framework for our MATRIX SmartContracts.

Here is a more detailed explanation.

1.Our Semantic Engine will use semantic analysis to explore vulnerabilities. We are introducing AI functionality for smart matching, which matches images based on CFG (Control Flow Graph) and DFG (Data Flow Graph).  

2.Our secure smart contracts are implemented through our Smart Contract SDK.   

3.The whole security protocol is guaranteed via formal verification.

4.Matrix is employing a dual approach to safeguard our smart contracts:

- A PC (Policy Checker) assesses vulnerabilities
- An IE (Inference Engine) and AI-assisted recognition detects vulnerabilities.


### Q2. Can you anticipated ROI for a Masternode and confirm whether the 10k token threshold is confirmed?

ROI in the Matrix project can be estimated based on the following model:

1.Of the remaining 40% of *1billion tokens:  
 
- 25% will be distributed to miners  
- 20% will be distributed to those who help with verification
- 50% will be distributed to power contributors doing AI computing

The remaining 5% of tokens will be used to reward our Matrix community and distributed according to community votes. 

This is the distribution ratio proposed by our Matrix Dev team.
We’re asking for consensus from the whole community to finalize the plan. 

We plan to share a distribution proposal every 6 months,
Then we will introduce a voting mechanism to survey the community. 

If no consensus is reached, we will go back to our initial proposal. 
And, we will switch to another one when possible.

2.Our Matrix PoW verification is based on the random selection of 21 masternodes. 

Each masternode will be awarded 10%  of the average mining rewards for a specified interval -- provided it is online long enough. 

The remaining 90% will be distributed based on a competition of computing power.  

When a miner is selected as a masternode, it will get a basic reward based on three rankings: 

1)Service time 

2)Deposits

3)and TPS. 

A miner can then compete for the remaining 90% of mining rewards based on computing power.  

The MCMC algorithms used for mining are created by CPU-like/GPU-like algorithm generator. 

3.In order to increase ROI and maximize rewards, 
we recommend people to deploy as much AI and CPU computing power as possible for external service. 

All computing power in the network will be pooled together. 
Any node sharing its computing power to work on an assignment will get a specific amount of reward, according to its share of the total work.

### Q3. Regarding the mining power that will be generated once the mainnet is launched, will the person mining be able to decide where his/her mining power generated will be utilized? For example, If I am mining the MAN coin, I want 50% of the power used by my machine to be used for cancer diagnosis and the remaining 50% to be used for building infrastructure...will this be possible?

We actually provide miners with three choices for how their mining power is utilized: 

They can choose to be either a:

- Verifier
- AI and GPU/CPU computing power contributor 
- Miner

Different requirements will apply to each class: 

A verifier, is responsible for maintaining the security of the network and avoiding fraudulent behaviors from miners or other verifiers. 
A minimum deposit of 100,000 MANs is required to become a verifier. 
The more, the closer to real-time.

The threshold to become a miner is a deposit of 10,000 MANs and minimum 1,000 TPS 
A miner will have a base reward, in addition to their mining reward. 

The core aim of Matrix is to pool computing power to serve for the whole network. 
This means assigning AI calculations for the participating nodes to complete. 

There may not be a high volume of tasks in the beginning, so we’ve introduced a class of computing tasks that provide a public service. 
These will have no rewards but honor value. 
Once a real task is assigned and completed, the system will automatically assign a considerable number of rewards.

Another option for earning rewards, is for a node to act as a “Dark Guardian.” This involves monitoring whether a verifier or miner is cheating. 

If a bad actor is discovered, it can broadcast across the network, and eliminate the cheater. 
It is then left for others to discuss how to reward this “guardian”. This form of reward is distributed by the foundation and is based on the timestamp.

### What protections and assurances will MATRIX offer Investors and companies planning an ICO on the MATRIX platform? (KYC, Compliance, no delays, fairness for everyone etc.)

MATRIX will conduct contract audits and security verifications. We will also further rely on contributors from our “Dark Guardian“ program to proactively identify vulnerabilities for swift corrective measures. 

### There are two stages for the mining first is FPGA and second stage is dedicated ASIC mining. Will MATRIX develop these themselves? (Or with others like AMD, NVidia, Bitmain)

We actually announced of part of our mining plans. In this May, we updated the GPU codes related with AI FPGA to Github, and our hardware AI computing will be desigined based on these codes. GPUs of AMD or NVidia will only be supported with the use of our software. 

### How can MATRIX solve semantic ambiguities when designing SmartContracts using AI?

The semantic ambiguity will be addressed through selection tips and templates.

We would like to take the following sentence for example: I am watching Lisa behind the telescope.

There are two possible impications. Lisa is behind the telescope; or I am using the telescope to watch Lisa.

As a matter of fact, the latter one makes more sense in the real scenarios.

And MATRIX uses similar methods to eliminate the semantic ambiguities and provide an explicit explanation how we understand and what we think. We will let users judge at their discretion.
