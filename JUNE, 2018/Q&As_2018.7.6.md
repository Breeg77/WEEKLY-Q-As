#### Q1. Can you explain more about the selection process for masternodes? Does holding more MAN increase the odds of being selected for a masternode? How many masternodes are available and for how long can someone be assigned as masternode?

ANSWER: There are two primary kinds of masternodes in the MATRIX project: Miner masternodes and Validation masternodes.

A miner masternode requires a deposit of 10K MAN and processing power to run 1,000 TPS. 
And a validation masternode requires a deposit of 100K MAN deposit and processing power to run 2,000 TPS.

### Miner node:

The selection occurs once per hour. This design provides a steady and standard time interval for leasing computing power. It also ensures every masternode has an opportunity to become a supernode. Statistically speaking, any given masternode is likely to be selected as SuperNode once every two weeks, even if there are 10,000 masternodes.
